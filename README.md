# Image Gallery
The gallery is defined in img_gallery.html under includes, there it searches for files that match the given path in assets and displays them
Note: This means that when is different directories images with the same name are contained, they are displayed for both posts.
<b>Always name images different, as they are thrown in one big pot.</b>


# Misc

The _misc directory contains some pages files that are currently not used but may be useful
- search.md: a search widget that can search in post data
- chart.md: a chart plot showing some data from the table data
